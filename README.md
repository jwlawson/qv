## libqv

Library to handle quiver mutations and some cluster algebra related things.

libqv uses googletest to test the code. To run the tests use `make test`, ensuring
that the googletest libraries and headers are installed in places where the
compiler will find them.

Run `make install` to install the library. By default it installs libqv.so to
`~/lib` and the headers files to `~/include`.
