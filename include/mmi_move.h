 * Header for the MMIMove class
 *
 * MMIMove represents a move that preserves the MMI-ness of a quiver.
 *
 * The move must match a subquiver of the provided quiver, then the move itself
 * consists of swapping this subquiver for a different one.
 *
 * There can be further constraints to when the move can apply to a quiver.
 * These are restrictions on the shape of the subquivers attached to the move's
 * subquiver.
