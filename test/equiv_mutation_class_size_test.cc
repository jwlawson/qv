	/**
	 * This test was included after a strange bug appeared only in this mutation
	 * class. At the 1458 matrix to be taken from the class, computing the 
	 * mutation at the 3rd vertex resulted in a call to the hash map for the
	 * matrix:
	 * { 	{ 0 -1 1 0 0 1 0 0 }
	 * 		{ 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 -1 }
	 * 		{ -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 }
	 * 		{ 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 }
	 * 		{ 0 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 }
	 * 		{ -1 0 0 -1 0 0 0 1 }
	 * 		{ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 }
	 * 		{ 0 1 0 0 0 -1 1 0 } }
	 *
	 * For some reason, the first time map_.count was called it would return 1,
	 * but then subsequent calls would return 0. Checking which matrix was
	 * considered 'equal' it was:
	 * { 	{ 0 0 1 0 -1 1 0 0 }
	 * 		{ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 }
	 * 		{ -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 }
	 * 		{ 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 }
	 * 		{ 1 -1 0 0 0 0 0 -1 }
	 * 		{ -1 0 0 -1 0 0 0 1 }
	 * 		{ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -1 }
	 * 		{ 0 0 0 0 1 -1 1 0 } }
	 *
	 * Checking these matrices separately (see equiv_quiver_matrix_test) these are
	 * *not* equivalent, yet for some reason they were coming up as equal.
	 *
	 * I changed the hashcode, so that these matrices no longer have the same
	 * hash, which seems to have prevented this from cropping up.
	 *
	 * The test is now ignored as it takes ~3 mins to run.
